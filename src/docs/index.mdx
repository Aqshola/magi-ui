# Welcome to MAGI-UI

MAGI-UI is a modern React component library inspired by the MAGI supercomputer system from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Our components combine the elegance of shadcn/ui with the technological aesthetic of the Evangelion universe, featuring clean interfaces, precise functionality, and systematic design patterns.

## The MAGI System Philosophy

Our design philosophy draws inspiration from the MAGI system's characteristics:

- **Systematic Architecture** - Components follow logical, hierarchical structures
- **Technological Precision** - Clean, functional interfaces with purposeful design
- **Modular Composition** - Building blocks that work together seamlessly
- **Advanced Functionality** - Sophisticated features with intuitive interfaces
- **Reliable Performance** - Robust components built for production use

## Component Categories

### Core Components
- Buttons with precise interaction patterns
- Cards with clean, structured layouts
- Navigation elements with systematic organization

### Form Components  
- Input fields with advanced validation
- Interactive controls with clear feedback
- Form layouts that guide user flow

### Layout Components
- Grid systems with responsive behavior
- Containers with flexible arrangements
- Spacing utilities for consistent rhythm

## Getting Started

All components are built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS v4. They follow the same API patterns as shadcn/ui components while adding the distinctive neobrutalism aesthetic.

```tsx
import { NeoButton } from '@/components/additional/neo-button'

function App() {
  return (
    <NeoButton variant="primary" size="lg">
      Click me!
    </NeoButton>
  )
}
```

## Design Principles

1. **Accessibility First**: All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. **TypeScript Native**: Full type safety out of the box
3. **Customizable**: Easy to theme and extend
4. **Performance**: Optimized for minimal bundle size
5. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive APIs and great documentation
